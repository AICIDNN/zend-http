<p><code>Zend\Http</code> is a primary foundational component of Zend Framework. Since much of
what PHP does is web-based, specifically HTTP, it makes sense to have a performant,
extensible, concise and consistent API to do all things HTTP.</p>

<p>Reporting Potential Security Issues</p>

<p>If you have encountered a potential security vulnerability, please DO NOT report it on the public issue tracker: send it to us at <a href="mailto:zf-security@zend.com">zf-security@zend.com</a> instead. We will work with you to verify the vulnerability and patch it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>When reporting issues, please provide the following information:</p>

<p>Component(s) affected
A description indicating how to reproduce the issue
A summary of the security vulnerability and impact
We request that you contact us via the email address above and give the project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new release prior to any public exposure; this helps protect users and provides them with a chance to upgrade and/or update in order to protect their applications.</p>

<p>For sensitive email communications, please use our PGP key.</p>

<p>RUNNING TESTS</p>

<p>Note: testing versions prior to 2.4</p>

<p>This component originates with Zend Framework 2. During the lifetime of ZF2, testing infrastructure migrated from PHPUnit 3 to PHPUnit 4. In most cases, no changes were necessary. However, due to the migration, tests may not run on versions &lt; 2.4. As such, you may need to change the PHPUnit dependency if attempting a fix on such a version.
To run tests:</p>

<p>Clone the repository:</p>

<p>$ git clone <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:zendframework/zend-http.git
$ cd
Install dependencies via composer:</p>

<p>$ curl -sS <a href="https://getcomposer.org/installer">https://getcomposer.org/installer</a> | php --
$ ./composer.phar install
If you don't have curl installed, you can also download composer.phar from <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">https://getcomposer.org/</a></p>

<p>Run the tests via phpunit and the provided PHPUnit config, like in this example:</p>

<p>$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
You can turn on conditional tests with the phpunit.xml file. To do so:</p>

<p>Copy phpunit.xml.dist file to phpunit.xml
Edit phpunit.xml to enable any specific functionality you want to test, as well as to provide test values to utilize.
Running Coding Standards Checks</p>

<p>This component uses php-cs-fixer for coding standards checks, and provides configuration for our selected checks. php-cs-fixer is installed by default via Composer.</p>

<p>To run checks only:</p>

<p>$ ./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix . -v --diff --dry-run --config-file=.php_cs
To have php-cs-fixer attempt to fix problems for you, omit the --dry-run flag:</p>

<p>$ ./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix . -v --diff --config-file=.php_cs
If you allow php-cs-fixer to fix CS issues, please re-run the tests to ensure they pass, and make sure you add and commit the changes after verification.</p>

<p>Recommended Workflow for Contributions</p>

<p>Your first step is to establish a public repository from which we can pull your work into the master repository. We recommend using GitHub, as that is where the component is already hosted.</p>

<p>Setup a GitHub account, if you haven't yet
Fork the repository (<a href="http://github.com/zendframework/zend-http">http://github.com/zendframework/zend-http</a>)
Clone the canonical repository locally and enter it.</p>

<p>$ git clone git://github.com:zendframework/zend-http.git
$ cd zend-http
Add a remote to your fork; substitute your GitHub username in the command below.</p>

<p>$ git remote add {username} <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:{username}/zend-http.git
$ git fetch {username}
Keeping Up-to-Date</p>

<p>Periodically, you should update your fork or personal repository to match the canonical ZF repository. Assuming you have setup your local repository per the instructions above, you can do the following:</p>

<p>$ git checkout master
$ git fetch origin
$ git rebase origin/master</p>

<h1>
<a id="optionally-to-keep-your-remote-up-to-date--" class="anchor" href="#optionally-to-keep-your-remote-up-to-date--" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OPTIONALLY, to keep your remote up-to-date -</h1>

<p>$ git push {username} master:master
If you're tracking other branches -- for example, the "develop" branch, where new feature development occurs -- you'll want to do the same operations for that branch; simply substitute "develop" for "master".</p>

<p>Working on a patch</p>

<p>We recommend you do each new feature or bugfix in a new branch. This simplifies the task of code review as well as the task of merging your changes into the canonical repository.</p>

<p>A typical workflow will then consist of the following:</p>

<p>Create a new local branch based off either your master or develop branch.
Switch to your new local branch. (This step can be combined with the previous step with the use of git checkout -b.)
Do some work, commit, repeat as necessary.
Push the local branch to your remote repository.
Send a pull request.
The mechanics of this process are actually quite trivial. Below, we will create a branch for fixing an issue in the tracker.</p>

<p>$ git checkout -b hotfix/9295
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix/9295'
... do some work ...</p>

<p>$ git commit
... write your log message ...</p>

<p>$ git push {username} hotfix/9295:hotfix/9295

   b5583aa..4f51698  HEAD -&gt; master
To send a pull request, you have two options.</p>

<p>If using GitHub, you can do the pull request from there. Navigate to your repository, select the branch you just created, and then select the "Pull Request" button in the upper right. Select the user/organization "zendframework" as the recipient.</p>

<p>If using your own repository - or even if using GitHub - you can use git format-patch to create a patchset for us to apply; in fact, this is recommended for security-related patches. If you use format-patch, please send the patches as attachments to:</p>

<p><a href="mailto:zf-devteam@zend.com">zf-devteam@zend.com</a> for patches without security implications
<a href="mailto:zf-security@zend.com">zf-security@zend.com</a> for security patches
What branch to issue the pull request against?</p>

<p>Which branch should you issue a pull request against?</p>

<p>For fixes against the stable release, issue the pull request against the "master" branch.
For new features, or fixes that introduce new elements to the public API (such as new public methods or properties), issue the pull request against the "develop" branch.
Branch Cleanup</p>

<p>As you might imagine, if you are a frequent contributor, you'll start to get a ton of branches both locally and on your remote.</p>

<p>Once you know that your changes have been accepted to the master repository, we suggest doing some cleanup of these branches.</p>

<p>Local branch cleanup</p>

<p>$ git branch -d 
Remote branch removal</p>

<p>$ git push {username} :</p>
